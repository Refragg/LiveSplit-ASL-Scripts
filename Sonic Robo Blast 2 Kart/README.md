# SRB2Kart autosplitter

This autosplitter is for **SRB2Kart**  
While it's a separate executable from SRB2, it works approximately like SRB2 which is really convenient.  
It is made to work with **major versions of Kart** (1.0.1 and latest for example)  
This splitter has **settings** so that you can control what it do and when.

Feel free to leave any suggestion to improve this script!

## Functions :

- **Start**
- **Split :** at end of track (and as an option on every lap)
- **Reset :** when choosing the first track ( /!\ on by default (I don't think I can change that))
- **IGT**

## How to use :

- **With a vanilla executable :**  

**Make sure** that your executable name is **srb2kart.exe** then in Livesplit, go to Edit Splits and click Activate.  

- **With a modded executable :**

As this splitter is currently exe dependent there's only **a few ones that works**  
You can find them in the "[Modded executables](https://github.com/R3FR4G/LiveSplit-ASL-Scripts/tree/master/Sonic%20Robo%20Blast%202%20Kart/Modded%20executables)" folder and then you want to follow the same steps as for the vanilla exe  

If you really want to use an other executable you can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/TyroneSama/f0a14ceb093dbc82629dcfd4f5c31725) and replace the paths to match yours. Executable name must be srb2kart.exe again
